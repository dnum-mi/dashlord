forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.</p><p></p><p>CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:</p><p>    * The victim has an active session on the target site.</p><p>    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.</p><p>    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.</p><p></p><p>CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response.

If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where \"shared\" caching servers such as \"proxy\" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.</p>"}]}],"sequences":[]},"nuclei":[],"lhr":[{"requestedUrl":"https://www.aube.gouv.fr/","finalUrl":"https://www.aube.gouv.fr/","fetchTime":"2025-05-13T01:47:17.940Z","runWarnings":[],"categories":{"performance":{"title":"Performance","supportedModes":["navigation","timespan","snapshot"],"id":"performance","score":0.46},"accessibility":{"title":"Accessibility","description":"These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility).
